# fastSort_java

Some sorting experiments. 

Currently it is a benchmark comparing regular Java sort (Array.sort) against a hybrid of samplesort and Arrays.sort. The samplesort hybrid is about 40% faster, when using randomly shuffled data, no duplicates, more than 100'000 entries. Of course more experiments would be needed to get a fair comparison, but it looks promising.
